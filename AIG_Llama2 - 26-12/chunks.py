    "text": "Hey everyone, this is Resma from Medirica and today I'll take you through a very interesting topic that is none other than deep learning. Unlike most of you even I'm deeply fascinated with artificial intelligence. Think about this. Instead of you doing all your work, you have a machine to finish it for you or it can do something which you thought was not possible. For instance, predicting the future, like predicting earthquake, tsunami, so that preventive measures can be taken to save lives. Chatbots, virtual personal assistance, like Siri in iPhones, Google Assistant, and believe me it is getting smarter day by day with deep learning. Cell driving cars, it will be a blessing for elderly people and disabled people who find it difficult to drive on their own. And on top of that, it can also avoid a lot of accidents that happen due to human error. Google AI doctor. So this is a recent initiative by Google, where Google is working with an Indian eye care chain to develop an AI software which can examine retina scans to identify a condition called diabetic retinopathy which can cause blindness. AI music composer. Who thought that we can have an AI music composer using deep learning and maybe in the coming years even machines will start winning Grammys and one of my favorites a dream reading machine. With so many unrealistic applications of AI and deep learning that we have seen so far I was wondering that whether we can capture dreams in the form of a video or something. And I wasn't surprised to find out that this was tried in Japan a few years back on three test subjects and they were able to achieve close to 60% accuracy. That is amazing. But I'm not sure whether people would want to be a test subject for this or not, because it can reveal all your dreams. Great. So this sets the base for you, and we are ready to understand what is artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is nothing but the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. AI is achieved by mimicking a human brain by understanding how it thinks, how it learns, and work while trying to solve a problem. For example, a machine playing chess or a voice activated software which helps you with various things in your phone or a number plate recognition system which captures the number plate of an over-speding car and processes it to extract the registration number and identify the owner of the car so that he can be charged. And all of this wasn't very easy to implement before deep learning. Now let's understand the various subsets of artificial intelligence. So till now, you'd have heard a lot about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning. However, do you know the relationship between all three of them? So deep learning is a subfield of a subfield of artificial intelligence. So it is a sub field of machine learning which is a subfield of artificial intelligence.",
